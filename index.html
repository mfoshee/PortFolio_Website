            <p>I am a versatile and dedicated UX/UI designer 
                and Art Director in the Washington D.C. area. 
                <br><br>
                I love a good puzzle with the thrill of understanding 
                the problem in order to figure out how all the pieces 
                fit together in a logical and delightful way.
                <br><br>
                A design challenge is like a good puzzle.</p>
            

            <div id="panel">
                <p>What pieces are we working with and how do we interact with them? What is needed to be assured success? How will the pieces fit together? And finally, can the intended audience complete the puzzle intuitively and without frustration? 
                <br><br>
                As a designer, I love to explore how we interact with a product and how all the pieces fit together to make the connections fit in a way that is simple and straightforward for our users. 
                <br>  <br> 
                Over the past 16 years I have worked collaboratively with cross functional teams 
                to create design solutions that work for my clients and their customers and communicate their messages concisely and on brand. My keys to success for any project have been listening (to both what is said as well as what is left unsaid), collaboration, and iteration. 
                <br> <br>  
                My diverse background in visual design, art direction, illustration, marketing, and entrepreneurship makes adapting to the many languages of the design process, from the client, to sales and marketing, to design and development, and everything in between effortless, helping to minimize miscommunication and costly mistakes. 
                I am a self starter and autonomous worker with a strong work ethic, but also thrive managing or collaborating with a team.
                                </p>

Not only is Michele a versatile designer, but also an expedient one! Her ability to diagnose a problem well despite time constraints is superseded only by her seemingly effortless managerial, regale command of a team of junior to mid-career designers of varied expertises. Michele truly empathizes with users deeply and does not cut corners in any of her deliverables. Her visual design aesthetic is charming and always comes with a delightfully meaningful story to match! Should you be looking for a mature UX professional with the expertise of an Art Directorâ€”look no moreâ€”Michele is your dream team gal! &nbsp; <i class="fas fa-quote-right" style="color:#DE007A; font-size: 30px; opacity: .7;"></i></p>

You see, skills and knowledge can be gained. That is important but not a key differentiator for a long-term successful team-member. Michelle consistently demonstrated: individual creativity, team collaboration and leadership abilities, commitment, and more. These qualities made her a prized addition to any project regardless of her specific role. I expect she'd be welcome and appreciated in any endeavor she was committed to. No reservations. &nbsp; <i class="fas fa-quote-right" style="color:#DE007A; font-size: 30px; opacity: .7;"></i></p>

Her extensive design experience proved to be extremely useful on a day to day basis.  She was always quick to help guide the team, offer help when needed, and offer her valuable insight into projects all while keeping a positive attitude.  Any company should be happy to have the pleasure of working with her. &nbsp; <i class="fas fa-quote-right" style="color:#DE007A; font-size: 30px; opacity: .7;"></i></p>

            I have been a client of Micheleâ€™s when she ran the Young Rembrandts Program in our school district. Michele is very passionate about creating Best in Class customer experience. Customer experience and understanding how to serve is what Michele knows very well, and itâ€™s extremely important when it comes to running a successful small business and Michele exemplifies this.
            <br><br>
            Specifically, I had the pleasure of working with Michele to bring a Young Rembrandts program to my childrenâ€™s school and share the wealth across other schools since art after-school and summer programs were not available at that time. She was empathetic to the particular needs of our school and families, making sure to offer a program that best suited the most families possible. Her dedication and enthusiasm to offer a program the children would love and learn from had a lasting effect on my children. This was the best after school and camp program my kids took because they learned important skills to express themselves through drawings and it helped them to visualize in later academic years to put together posters and PowerPoint presentations to make complex problems clear through colors, art effects etc. which they learned at a very young age. To this day, I enjoy when they are making me beautiful drawings and excel in school. Thank you Michele for your dedication to childrenâ€™s education and your relentless efforts as a small business owner! &nbsp; <i class="fas fa-quote-right" style="color:#DE007A; font-size: 30px; opacity: .7;"></i></p>

She elevated our digital presence and led the way on a complete and comprehensive redesign of all business line logos. Her enthusiasm and commitment to projects and her team are inspiring and invigorating. She managed an incredibly demanding position with grace and determination. Her ability to focus on small details as well as her "big picture" thinking served her well in a very fast-paced environment with multiple programs, schools and businesses.
